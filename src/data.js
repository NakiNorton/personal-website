  aboutMeSection0: "Software Engineer, avid traveller, hiker, amateur snowboarder (learning at 29 is hard!!)." ,
  aboutMeSection1: "I’m a graduate of Turing School of Software Design’s Front-End Software Engineering program which is a seven month immersive program focused on project-based learning. The 70-80 hrs a week I put into this program has enabled me to develop a solid foundation to kick-off my new career as a software engineer. Having graduated from this challenging program, I know that I can do anything that I set my mind to.",
  aboutMeSection2: "To be honest, this program was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But that’s why I got into tech; for the challenge, the fulfilment, and sense of purpose I feel when I’m challenged to grow both professionally and personally. With the continual innovation in tech there is no shortage of things to learn, and ways that I can use my skills to make a positive impact. I was also attracted to a career in software engineering as I’ve always loved being able to exercise my creativity with hands-on work (tinkering with woodwork, sewing, painting). When I code, I start to lose track of time and become fully engaged in what I'm doing - it's a great feeling.",
  aboutMeSection3: "Prior to Turing... I grew up in New Zealand with dual New Zealand/USA citizenship and I bought a one-way ticket to Boston in 2015. I wanted to explore the USA and make the most of my dual citizenship. I ended up working in Boston for 4 years as an Executive Assistant in the consulting industry. After moving to Denver, CO (where I currently reside) in late 2019, I decided to address the nagging feeling that a career as an Executive Assistant wasn’t the right path to continue on. This led me to a period of self-reflection, career exploration, and online coding courses. I quickly fell in love with coding and after speaking to people in the industry I decided to commit to a career change in early 2020 and enrolled at Turing for its project based learning, and longer ‘bootcamp’ program.",

      description: 'LienFlash is a client backed app built for a team of lawyers who have experienced frustration in dealing with the Lien filing process. LienFlash is a Progressive Web App, it can be used in the browser or it can be installed on a desktop or a mobile device. The app allows a user to login as either a general user (client) or an admin.  Users can create a new job, track that job in the lien process, and submit the job info to an administrator when they are ready to submit a Notice of Intent, Lien, or Release of Lien. Users are sent SMS notifications to remind them of upcoming deadlines. We are currently building out the Administrators dashboard using the Material UI Data Grid component. The admin will be able to see all jobs (across all users) displayed on the Data Grid, click on a job to see all of the job details, and update the status of a job once they\'ve processed the paperwork. The updated job status will then be reflected on the users/clients account. This app was developed with two front-end developers (myself and one other) and a back-end team.',
