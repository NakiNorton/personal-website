        <p className="paragraph">I’m a graduate of Turing School of Software Design’s Front-End Software Engineering program which is a seven month immersive program focused on project-based learning. The 70-80 hrs a week I put into this program has enabled me to develop a solid foundation to kick-off my new career as a software engineer."</p>
        <p className="paragraph">To be honest, this program was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But that’s why I got into tech; for the challenge, the fulfilment, and sense of purpose I feel when I’m challenged to grow both professionally and personally. With the continual innovation in tech there is no shortage of things to learn, and ways that I can use my skills to make a positive impact. I was also attracted to a career in software engineering as I’ve always loved being able to exercise my creativity with hands-on work (tinkering with woodwork, sewing, painting). When I code, I start to lose track of time and become fully engaged in what I'm doing - it's a great feeling.</p>

        <p className="paragraph">Prior to Turing... I grew up in New Zealand with dual New Zealand/USA citizenship and I bought a one-way ticket to Boston in 2015. I wanted to explore the USA and make the most of my dual citizenship. I ended up working in Boston for 4 years as an Executive Assistant in the consulting industry. After moving to Denver, CO (where I currently reside) in late 2019, I decided to address the nagging feeling that a career as an Executive Assistant wasn’t the right path to continue on. This led me to a period of self-reflection, career exploration, and online coding courses. I quickly fell in love with coding and after speaking to people in the industry I decided to commit to a career change. In early 2020 and enrolled at Turing for its project based learning, and longer ‘bootcamp’ program.</p>
