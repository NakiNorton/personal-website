          <p className="paragraph u-margin-top-medium">Hi! I’m Stephanie Norton, a frontend software engineer based in Denver, CO. I love transforming ideas into working features and I'm continously honing my skills. I've been working predominantly with React & I enjoy the design aspect of front-end development but I’m also interested in expanding my knowledge and experience in back-end tech & branching into mobile app development. <br />
          <br />After graduating from Turing School of Software & Design in November 2020 I joined an early stage startup on a contract basis. Joining one month prior to product launch, I dove into the code base to iterate & improve on existing features and built major new features that contributed to it being number one on Product Hunt.<br /><br />I have proven experience working both collaboratively and independently to deliver quality results. I'd love to chat if you have a full-time opportunity that you think I could be a good fit for!
          </p>
