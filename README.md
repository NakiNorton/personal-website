### Project in Action

### Challenges:
I was incredibly indecisive about the overall design and layout. I nearly finished my portfolio about two times before scrapping it and moving in a new direction. I would have benefited from more brainstorming, design research, and wireframes before I started coding. All iterations were done in the same repo and in hindsight I should have started a fresh repo to keep things clean. I'm still not 100% happy with everything, but I'm close enough!
